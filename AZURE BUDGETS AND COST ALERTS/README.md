# AZURE BUDGETS AND COST ALERTS

In whatever case, it is ALWAYS an important first step to create budgets and set cost alerts for an organization or business.

This is to avoid unforeseen spending and billing and to proactively manage costs because at the end of the day cloud is all about
being cost-effective to an individual or an enterprise.

Azure budgets is fundamental in managing and optimizing the costs of your solutions.

If your environment is well structured and organised, it makes it easier to monitor and analyse your costs accurately and effectively.

Azure budgets also provides an overview of cost data which can help analyse your historical, present costs and eventually assist you to determine 
forecast costs.

Cost alerts: these serve as alarms and reminders and can be set on actual or forecasted basis to remind you when you're near exhausting your budget.

The process of setting budgets and cost alerts is as follows:

You sign in to your Azure portal and click on cost management then click on budgets.

At the top, there will be an add option, choose it and fill in a unique budget name, in my case I filled: FirstAZBudget.

For the reset period you're given: monthly, quaterly and annually, I chose monthly, this gives a more accurate pattern when you want to track your
spending.

Next you are required to set a budget amount threshold, what I did, I set a budget of 10 US dollars, which directly leads to the next step of setting alerts.

On the alerts, I set a forecast alert at 50%  which will alert me when I am almost at 5.00 US dollars, I set a forecast alert at 75%  which will
alert me when I'm almost at 8.00 US dollars and I set an actual alert at 100% which will alert me when I'm exactly at 10.00 US dollars. 

The budget and cost alerts are set, and now, you're allowed to proceed with provisioning without worrying on unexpected costs!

This is the final overview of FirstAZBudget and its cost alerts.
